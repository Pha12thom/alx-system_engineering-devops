2 min read


When you type “google.com” in your browser and press Enter, a series of events occur behind the scenes that most people are not aware of to display the website on screen.


Here’s what really happens when you click “Enter” in your browser.

DNS Request: Your device requests the IP address for the URL “google.com” from the Domain Name System (DNS) server. This service is provided by your internet service provider or a third-party DNS server.
2. TCP/IP: Your device creates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server using a 3-way handshake. This process establishes a communication channel between your device and the Google server.

3. Firewall: Your device’s firewall checks the incoming and outgoing traffic for any potential threats or security issues. It allows or blocks the communication based on predefined rules and settings.

4. HTTPS/SSL: Before the device sends the HTTP GET request, it needs to establish a secure connection with the server using HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure). SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data sent between two systems.

5. Load-balancer: If the server is busy or experiencing high traffic, a load-balancer may distribute the request to one of multiple servers to handle the load. This ensures that the server remains responsive and can handle additional requests.

6. Web Server: The web server processes the HTTP GET request and sends the requested webpage content back to your device.

7. Application Server: If the requested page requires dynamic content or interaction, the application server processes the request and generates the appropriate response.

8. Database: The application server may interact with a database to retrieve or update data related to the requested page or user.

In summary, when you type “google.com” in your browser and press Enter, your device goes through a series of steps involving DNS, TCP/IP, firewall, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancer, web server, and application server to display the website on your screen. This process ensures a secure and efficient browsing experience while protecting your data and providing fast access to the information you need.
